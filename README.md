1) Every Go file starts with a package name. Here we have used package main
2) func main comes under package main 
3) In the Go file other packages will be imported by import keyword
4) We have imported fmt package which will be used inside main fucntion to print o/p to console.
5) 2 ways to write import "fmt" or import ("fmt")
6) main is a special function as always and the program execution starts from there. Braces are the same as it was in C
7) For Calling a function we need to use package.fucntion() syntax
